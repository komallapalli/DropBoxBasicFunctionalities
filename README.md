# DropBoxBasicFunctionalities

This Repo has two codes. 

1. DropBox.py 
2. DropBoxWithDB.py 

In DropBox.py, I used in-memory database to store metadata of the files. In DropBoxWithDB.py, I used SQLLite as Database to store metadata of the files.

Schema fo the database: You can find Schema information in DatabaseScehma.txt file.

Steps to run the code: You can find the steps in Commands.txt file.
